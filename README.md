# maptask

Requirements: Python 2.7

Usage: In main code directory, `python mt_main.py`

A computerised version of the Map Task (Anderson et al., 1991) maps 0 and 4.

The program is designed to describe the route to a participant who then completes the task by drawing the route on the map (maps are openly available at http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/maptask/#maps). The system will describe the route three times in each of the natural and synthetic speech conditions.

Synthetic speech provided by the Festival speech synthesis system by the Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edinburgh ( http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/).

Natural speech  recorded in an isolation booth using a Shure SM7 cardioid microphone, and encoded using a Digidesign 003. All sound files have a sample rate of 16kHz, a bit depth of 16bit, and the command-line utility Normalize was used to normalise the sound levels across all sound files (http://normalize.nongnu.org/).

Output contains the number of turns taken to complete the interaction and time taken to complete the task.
